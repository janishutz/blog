What can you expect from this blog?

I am planning to write about a lot of different topics, but mostly about Linux, the Open Source world, software development, and occasionally I'll create some guides

## Who am I?
You can visit my [about me page](https://janishutz.com/about/aboutme) on my [main website](https://janishutz.com)

In short, I do software development and am a Linux enthusiast and open source advocate.

## How often will there be new posts?
This is something I haven't decided on, and I probably won't have a schedule, like ever. There will be a new post, if I find a topic to write about that is interesting or pressing currently or just a massive rant about some stupid development in the world of tech.

## How is the content organized?
I try to keep everything organized as much as possible and might go in and change categories and tags of older articles to other ones if I find that new tags or categories fit the content of the article better.

## How was this website created?
Usually, I do my own stuff, but this time, for simplicity reasons, I have chosen to go with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator, and I am using the [DoIt theme](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/DoIt) for it.
