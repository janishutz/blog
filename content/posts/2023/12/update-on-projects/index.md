I have not been posting much here over the past half a month, as I have been busy working on various projects and also planning a few projects. So, here's what projects are currently ongoing and what projects are upcoming

# Language School Hossegor Booking System Version 2
It's been a while since I have worked on the booking system, but the new version is progressing nicely. I haven't talked much about this project publicly, but it is available at [https://booking.languageschoolhossegor.com?lang=en](https://booking.languageschoolhossegor.com?lang=en). The new version will probably be ready in about two weeks as of the of writing this article, so shortly after new year. The upgrades to the system include for example user accounts which can be used to track the status of your booking.

# A cross-platform iOS, iPadOS, Android, Windows, MacOS and Linux App
This project was originally started about one and a half years ago, but will be rewritten from scratch as I hadn't made much progress yet. There is no release date set yet, but I expect it to release either in April or July. Additionally, the name of the app is not yet decided. I will not be revealing more about the project just yet, so stay tuned for an update and subscribe to the RSS feed, if you want to receive all posts in a handy feed. 

# impress.js V3
impress.js has been something I have been working on occasionally over the last year, but I want to get back into it and re-engineer it to make it more flexible and customizable. You can see the status [here](https://github.com/simplePCBuilding/impress.js), and you can see what is planned [here](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/issues/863).

# smuL
For smuL there are a few ideas on where to go from here. A friend of mine found an interesting project on which I could rebase the project. There aren't any concrete plans for that work just yet.

# QR & Barcode Insight Android Port
When I find the time, I will be porting the QR & Barcode Insight App to Android and also giving it a few updates on the iOS side.

# StorageManager
I will probably partially or fully rewrite that app to make it more flexible, reliable and feature-rich. No timeline for this decided on just yet.
