store.janishutz.com launched today!


# Launch of store.janishutz.com

I am very excited to inform you that [store.janishutz.com](https://store.janishutz.com) launched today! From now on, you can purchase non-free software I develop there, as well as donate to my projects through it.


# Features

The store uses the secure login system that I built, which is hosted at [id.janishutz.com](https://id.janishutz.com). You can then pay securely through the payment gateway Stripe. There is very little information on you handed to Stripe automatically by the system, only your email address is, as this is required. There is also a donation feature, which you can use to donate me some money, if you appreciate what I do!
