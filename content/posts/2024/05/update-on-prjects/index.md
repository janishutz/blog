It's again been a while since my last article, but today I had big news. I had previously teased the project, but I hadn't announced it officially. 

I have finally finished my written finals exams, giving me lots more time to spend on coding, relaxing and preparing for the oral exams that are still due. 

# Software releases

- Janishutz ID: May 31st 2024 (actually released: May 27th 2024)
- Software Store: June 30th 2024
- ConductorCalc: September 15th 2024
- Discord Bot: TBA
- Graphical Impress.js editor: TBA

These dates are not set in stone, as there might be some issues arising, postponing the releases.

# Janishutz ID
This project is mostly done, only thing left is to finish bug-testing, which I am currently working on while I am developing the store. Most bugs have been ironed out by now. If you'd like to help me iron out the last ones, you can [sign up for an account](https://id.janishutz.com) (which will not transfer to the full release). If you find a bug, contact me through my [support system](https://support.janishutz.com/index.php?a=add&category=7).

# Software Store
There is a [full article on the store](https://blog.janishutz.com/posts/2024/05/store/). In short, what I still need to do, is implement the payment gateways, finish the account services, maybe add an admin panel, but that will probably have to wait, as that's simply to make my life a bit easier. (An early beta, backend-less version of the store is available at [https://store-testing.janishutz.com](https://store-testing.janishutz.com). There might be an SSL warning, which you can skip, as I haven't fully configured that page yet.)

# ConductorCalc
This project is still in early planning phase, as I still have to finish the store to even begin implementing this software. The algorithms are developed though and only need translating into TypeScript. 


# Discord Bot
This project is currently in the early planning stages, some of the features have been laid out. This bot will be subscription-based and will also be used for my own discord server. There is currently no ETA for when the bot will be finished, and I will keep you posted with updates.


# Graphical Impress.js editor
I haven't even started planning this project. This means, it'll be awhile until it launches. Additionally, it's fairly difficult to implement with a "one-man show". Since that software will be closed-source and paid, collaboration is not that easy. If you would still be willing to help me implement it, please [contact me](https://support.janishutz.com/index.php?a=add&category=1).
