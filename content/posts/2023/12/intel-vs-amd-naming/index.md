We do all agree that the naming schemes of most GPUs and CPUs is kinda stupid. 

Now Intel has decided to create a press release that shames AMD for allegedly using old architectures in their new CPUs. Good thing Intel tells us that this is a stupid idea. First off, it wasn't even true and secondly... Intel's kinda infamous for doing exactly that. All CPUs from Skylake to Rocket Lake used basically the same architecture based on the 14 nm node. Well Intel kinda just went on to add pluses to the end, so Rocket Lake (11th "Gen") ended up being basically 14nm+++++
