Today, I am very pleased to announce that the store has received a big update and that there are new products available on the store.

Over the last two weeks I haven't had particularly much time, but I still managed to finish the store update.

# New Products
There are a few new products available on the store, most notably a whole array of maths summaries for basic topics. Next to that, the MusicPlayer subscription can now be viewed on the store, but since the player isn't fully ready just yet, this subscription isn't live yet. Additionally, parts of the pricing of ConductorCalc is now public on the store. These prices are still subject to change. I have also acquired the domain for ConductorCalc, [conductorcalc.com](https://conductorcalc.com). Currently, there is only a temporary website up, where you can see the project's logo.


# Store Update
I have finally introduced a first bigger store update, which includes some small bug fixes, pre-orders, a PDF reader and backend infrastructure updates. Additionally, the Store-SDK is now basically done, which is needed for me to finish MusicPlayer.
