As announced previously, I am working on a Software Store at [https://store.janishutz.com](https://store.janishutz.com).

I expect the store to launch within the next two or so months, as there is still a lot to do, but a lot has been implemented already. The title image of this post is a preview on how the store is going to look. I opted to create a very modern look. 


# Offering
Currently, the planned offering for the launch of the store is libreevent setup, donations and libreevent maintenance (which is keeping your libreevent instance up to date). After the launch, some more products will make it to the store, including ConductorCalc, which should arrive by the end of October, if everything goes according to plan. I might add more products to the store before launch, in case I forgot about something here or if I manage to develop something before the store's launch. Stay tuned here to get more updates on the store's launch.


# Joining as seller
The store will allow other developers to sell their software, at a per-transaction fee, which still has to be determined, as it strongly depends on the payment gateway I end up using. Developers selling their software here will get access to SDKs. More of that will be explained on the actual store page, once that is up. If you are already interested in joining, please [contact](https://janishutz.com/support/contact) me. 


# Privacy
All your payment information will never reach my servers, they will stay with the payment gateway. 


# When will I receive my product?
You will receive your product as soon as the store receives the payment complete status from the payment provider.


# Can I get a refund?
You can get a refund, but I expect that you will have to pay approximately 10% of the purchase price, as there are fees connected to refunds for me.
