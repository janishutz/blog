Welcome back to your (mostly) monthly dose of project updates!


This month, there was not too much to cover in terms of progress.


# ConductorCalc
ConductorCalc has seen the largest amount of work this week. The main UI is now much more complete, but that's about everything that I have managed to do this month.


# MusicPlayer
Yes, I know I have completed MusicPlayer last month, but this time around, I have improved crash recovery, allowing users to sign in again, if the MusicPlayer backend were to crash. Also, I have now finally finalized the FOSS version, and it will be published soon.


And that is basically it. I have just started university, so my time from now on will be quite limited, as was already the case in September. During September I have also now finally done the CPE examination and passed that at Grade A, so I can now confidently say, that my English level is adequate.
