**TL;DR;**

I will be adding privacy preserving product analytics to my websites over the coming months. These analytics will not allow me to uniquely identify you. You can see my revised privacy policy [here](https://janishutz.com/legal/privacy) and my old one [here](https://janishutz.com/legal/privacy/v1).


# What will change
I will be adding P3A (Privacy Preserving Product Analytics) to my websites step-by-step over the coming months. This will allow me to see what pages are viewed how often and at what times my websites are most commonly viewed. *(This blog won't be affected btw)*

# How will this data be collected?
I will be using Matomo Analytics, which I host myself at [https://analytics.janishutz.com](https://analytics.janishutz.com). It is configured in the most privacy respecting way possible:
- S

TODO: Add exact config here

# What happens with your data?
None of the data will allow me to uniquely identify you! I am not interested to know what an individual user does, but how the average user interacts with my website. None of the collected data will ***EVER*** be sold or handed over to anybody and is only accessible to me. This is the reason to why I do not use Google Analytics or anything similar, because my user's privacy is my foremost concern when developing software. This is why my support system does not require you to sign up. You can get priority support once my store is up and running if you own a product that includes it when logging in.

# Opting out of this data collection
You will have the option to disable the data collection by scrolling all the way down and unchecking "Allow P3A" in the bottom left corner. I would though strongly encourage you to leave this enabled to help me optimize my services and focus on the most important aspects instead of wasting time and resources on features barely anybody uses.
