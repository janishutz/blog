I haven't written any blog posts in over a month. This is because I have taken some time off from coding to focus on my finals exams and to prepare for my studies, which, if everything goes according to plan, should start this September. 

But there are also some coding projects which I have been working on over the last two months.


## ConductorCalc
I have previously mentioned that I was working on a project that is cross-platform and will be available on all major OSes. The name is now almost certain. It will be a software for calculating various values when building high voltage lines. I expect a release by the end of October 2024, as there is still much to do.


## id.janishutz.com
To allow for easy-to-use (for me at least) account setups, I have decided to create a single sign on service myself that can be integrated into all of my online services. 

## store.janishutz.com
Since I also want and need to start making money off of developing software, I will be launching my web-store most likely by the end of July where I will be selling access to new and upcoming software, like ConductorCalc.

## impress.js
impress.js is a project I have been contributing to occasionally for the past 1.5 years. I am currently working on a massive update, that will essentially be a full rewrite, which will make impress.js more flexible, but will ditch support for old browsers like IE.

## impress.js graphical editor
Since there are not really any mature graphical impress.js presentation editors out there, I will be creating my own, starting from scratch, directly with impress.js V3 and its changes in mind. This software will be paid though, and I am not planning on open-sourcing any of its components other than the plugins I wrote for and the changes I made to impress.js.


Next to all of those projects, I will be working on general improvements to my websites and I will be adding Privacy Preserving Product Analytics to my websites. If you are interested, you can read up on this [here](/posts/2024/04/analytics)
